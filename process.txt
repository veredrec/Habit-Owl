About the process and the steps to develop the Chrome extension:

1. The different pages are going to be actually one popup page and javascript would serve only one of them each time the user clicks a menu button or submits the form. So actually one big HTML file.
2. Data would be saved in localStorage.
3. Data would be visualized using D3? (still need to decide) If yes - follow this tutorial: https://vis4.net/blog/2015/04/making-html-tables-in-d3-doesnt-need-to-be-a-pain/ or: http://bl.ocks.org/jfreels/6734025.

4. Logo would be designed in Illustrator.

Tasks:
- Readme with User stories to define the scope and steps
- Functionality for all parts
- D3 for data visualization
- Local storage to store user data

var task1 = 'Hello!';
localStorage.setItem('task1', task1);
// function getData
